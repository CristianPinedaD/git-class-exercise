**WARNING:** This repository is under 24/7 surveillance by the Git Police 🚔

### Fun Facts About Git:
- Git was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 after a dramatic falling out with BitKeeper. He built it in just 2 weeks because he was *that* annoyed. Talk about productive anger! 😤
- The name "Git" is British slang for "unpleasant person." Linus called it that as a joke about himself. Self-deprecating humor at its finest! 🤷
- There are more git jokes than actual commits in this repository (current count: ∞)

### Git Commands You'll Learn to Fear and Love:
```bash
git commit -m "fixed stuff"          # The commit message of champions
git push --force                     # YOLO! (Don't actually do this)
git rebase                           # Time travel, but scarier
git merge                            # When branches hug it out
git stash                            # Where forgotten code goes to cry
git blame                            # For when you need to find who to... thank
```

### Inspirational Git Quotes:
> "In Git we trust, all others we `git blame`" - Anonymous Developer

> "There are two types of programmers: those who commit directly to main, and liars" - Ancient Proverb

> "I don't always test my code, but when I do, I do it in production" - Not recommended by Fulin & Cristian

### Remember:
- Always write meaningful commit messages (like "asdfasdf" or "fdsfs")
- Never commit your passwords (unless they're really good ones)
- `git push --force` is like the nuclear option - use responsibly! ☢️

**May your merges be conflict-free and your commits be atomic!** ✨
